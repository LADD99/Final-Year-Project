Stegano Steganography Program

'toSteg' has images in for example purposes

-NOTE-
1. Do not remove program from folder structure
2. All images must be named numerically in sequence
3. There are 3 data folders in the data folder to save running time, however the full 10 used in the project are in the 'extra' folder.

-RUNNING-
1. When you run the program, it will ask for 4 inputs, an inout folder, a data folder, an output folder and a file type.

2. In this example, the only input folder available 'toSteg'. The data folder is 'Data' and the output folder is 'Stegged' and all the images are '.png'

3. Each data file will now be embedded into each image, and save in thier corrersponding folders - This may take some time.
