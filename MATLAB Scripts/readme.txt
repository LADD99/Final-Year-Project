This folder has all the MATLAB scripting used throughout this project. They require the data created by the python programs to be in the master MATLAB directory.

There are 2 types of script, one to load the data from the aforementioned histogram data files, and another to feed that data into the neural networks.
Instead of creating multiple of the same script for a single change, the same script with used and variables were altered by me when needed.
